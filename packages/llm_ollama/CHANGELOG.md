## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- `batchEmbed()` implementation: delegates to existing batch-capable `embed()` (Ollama `/api/embed` accepts an array of inputs).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Ensured Ollama tool calls always produce `LLMToolCall` instances with non-null, non-empty `id` values, synthesizing IDs when Ollama does not provide them.
- Aligned tool-calling behavior with `llm_core`'s `toolCallId` validation so that tool execution no longer fails with `Tool message must have toolCallId` when used together with `llm_core`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Builder pattern for `OllamaChatRepository` via `OllamaChatRepositoryBuilder` for complex configurations
- Support for `StreamChatOptions` in `streamChat()` method
- Support for `chatResponse()` method for non-streaming complete responses
- Support for `RetryConfig` and `TimeoutConfig` for advanced request configuration
- Input validation for model names and messages

### Changed
- `streamChat()` now accepts optional `StreamChatOptions` parameter
- Improved error handling and retry logic
- Enhanced documentation
