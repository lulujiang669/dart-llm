## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- Bumped `llm_core` dependency to ^0.1.8 for tool calling stream visibility

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- `batchEmbed()` implementation: delegates to existing batch-capable `embed()` (OpenAI embeddings API accepts array of strings).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Ensured conversion from ChatGPT `tool_calls` to `LLMToolCall` always yields non-null, non-empty `id` values, synthesizing IDs should the OpenAI response omits them.
- Improved interoperability with `llm_core`'s strict `toolCallId` validation for tool messages in tool-calling workflows.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Builder pattern for `ChatGPTChatRepository` via `ChatGPTChatRepositoryBuilder` for complex configurations
- Support for `StreamChatOptions` in `streamChat()` method
- Support for `chatResponse()` method for non-streaming complete responses
- Support for `RetryConfig` and `TimeoutConfig` for advanced request configuration
- Input validation for model names and messages
- Improved stream parsing with `GptStreamConverter`

### Changed
- `streamChat()` now accepts optional `StreamChatOptions` parameter
- Improved error handling and retry logic
- Enhanced documentation
